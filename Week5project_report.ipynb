    "> A local contractor of Etobicoke, Toronto is going to build a food warehouse for ingredients processing and cold storage to provide food delivery service to the nearby restaurants. The neighborhoods where the warehouse is to be built is undetermined yet but the decision will be made based on the density and popularity of the restaurants in each neighborhood in Etobicoke.  The optimal site is the neighborhood with a large number of restaurants will high reputation among customers so that the warehouse can provide timely service for restaurants to maintain their quality service to customers as will as control the overall delivery cost.\n",

We also care about the popularity of the restaurants and any factors that may have an impact on the cost of the delivery service."

    "> We will use K-means clustering to cluster the neighborhoods and sort the cluster by checking the mean values of restaurants. A higher score simply imply that the neighborhood has a high density of restaurants and is a more desirable choice for the contracter to build his warehouse."
